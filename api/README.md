It is possible to observe in the image above all possible commands, but in case of updating the value of product, Variety and sellers, it is necessary to change the ID of each one to change the name or the displayed value.
But to be able to add values â€‹â€‹to this table when it is empty, make sure that the Variety table is populated correctly.
